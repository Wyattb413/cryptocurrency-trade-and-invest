Doji | Opening and closing price are almost the same _* might signify a reversal in trend_
Engulfing | When a bull candle is almost entirely englufed by a bear candle or vice versa _* might signify a reversal in trend_

### Section 2 Leture 11

#### RSI Indicator

Displays frquency graph on a basis of 0-100 where above 70 indicated where there was an over-buy and below 30 indicated where there was over-sell.

- **Divergence** - Where the price per unit graph indicates that the price is going up, but the RSI indicator shows that the price is going down or vice versa _* a good indicator in a reversal in trend_

The significance of the **divergence** is higher when the RSI trend line takes place in the above-70 or below-30 areas

### Section 2 Lecture 12

#### MAC D Indicator

_Moving Average Convergence Divergence_ - consits of two indicating lines: the **signal line**, which moves faster than the other and the **MAC D line**

When the **MAC D** line has crossed the **zero-line**, this signifies a _high potential in trend reversal_

Another possible signifier of _reversal of trend_ is when the **MAC D line** crosses of the **signal line**

**Bullish indicator**: when the **MAC D line** crosses above the **signal line** _* potential up trend_

**Bearish indicator**: when the **MAC D line** crosses below the **signal line** _* potential down trend_

A **divergence** (when the **MAC D line** and the **signal line** are moving futher apart) indicates more momentum in price

A **convergence** (when the **MAC D line** and the **signal line** are moving closer together) indicates the momentum in price is slowing down
